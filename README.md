# Required software/dependencies

To run the code in the notebook some software packages are required. The code was written and tested in the versions listed below but may work in older version of the software. All packages are available in the latest version of the anaconda distribution of python.

1. Python v3.8.3
2. Numpy v1.18.5
3. Seaborn v0.10.1
4. Matplotlib v3.2.2

# Using the Jupyter Notebook
***
To run the notebook on your machine you will need to have Juptyer installed. If you have the anaconda distribution you should already have Jupyter installed [1]. If not running anaconda and you have pip installed you can download Jupyter using the `pip install` command in the command line like below.
```
pip install jupyter
```
Now that you have Jupyter installed, you can download the notebook. To launch the notebook app navigate to the directory the file is stored in on the command line and enter the `jupyter notebook` command as below:
```
>>> jupyter notebook
```
The jupyter notebook app should launch in your browser and should contain the contents of the directory you were in. Simply select the numpy.random.ipynb notebook file to open in the browser. [1]

All code cells contain examples of code detailed in Markdown cells. Each task should work independantly of each other. All required external modules are imported at the beggining of each task. Within each task each code cell is designed to be run in order of appearence. If you receive an error codes make sure that the code has been run in order. Code can be run using the keyboard shortcut `Shift + Enter`
